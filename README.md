# Coin Change Combinations

This program calculates the number of ways to make change for a dollar (100 cents) using common US coins, including quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents), and pennies (1 cent).

## Exercise Description

In US currency, there are four common coin denominations:

- Quarters (25 cents)
- Dimes (10 cents)
- Nickels (5 cents)
- Pennies (1 cent)

The goal of this exercise is to find out how many different combinations of these coins can be used to make change for a dollar (100 cents).

## Program Implementation

The program is implemented in Java. It calculates the number of combinations using a dynamic programming approach. It considers all possible combinations of the given coin denominations to make a dollar.
