# CoinChanger

Please complete the exercise below and provide us with your solution. During your interview we
will discuss your solution to see if you’d be a good fit. It’s less important if the end result works
or not rather than what choices you made and why.
You can use your preferred programming language. The solution should be available to us on
github.
Write a program that demonstrates the following exercise:
There are four types of common coins in US currency:
quarters (25 cents)
dimes (10 cents)
nickels (5 cents)
pennies (1 cent)
There are 6 ways to make change for 15 cents:
A dime and a nickel;
A dime and 5 pennies;
3 nickels;
2 nickels and 5 pennies;
A nickel and 10 pennies;
15 pennies.
How many ways are there to make change for a dollar
using these common coins? (1 dollar = 100 cents)
